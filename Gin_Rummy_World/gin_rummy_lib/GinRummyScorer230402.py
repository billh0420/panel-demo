# Gin Rummy Scoring function
#
# A player gets 1 point for going out (knock or gin) else 0 points (dead hand or lose).
#
# The DQNAgent needs to learn how to form and keep melds so that he can go out.
#
# The DQNAgent should pickup the discard when it would form a meld. Otherwise, he should draw a card (altough an exper player might break this rule sometimes).
